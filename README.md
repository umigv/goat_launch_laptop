# goat_launch_laptop
This repo was built by the Sensors team in 2018-2019 and contains everything necessary to launch the sensor stack. The "nuc_competition_combined" launch file should be run, followed by running "clear_costmap_scripts.sh" in a new terminal. "nuc_competition_combined_visualize" can also be used to visualize the sensor stack and verify that everthing is running. Further documentation can be found on the team's Drive.

NOTE: this code should eventually be merged into goat_launch.
